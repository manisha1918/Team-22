2> Connect the ATMega board via an USB cable to the system.
3> Open the IDE, Include the associated libraries by installing them either through the library 
   manager or through the web.
4> Upload the code to the IDE.
6> Verify the Arduino board and the port to avoid failure.
5> Compile the code and if any errors are found troubleshoot it.
7> Once the code is compiled, Upload the code to the ATMega microcontroller.
8> Click on the Serial Monitor and click send for the messages to appear.
